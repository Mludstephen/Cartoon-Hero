		<!-- Characteristics-->
		<h2>Rango's Characteristics:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Rango is a lonely pet lizard with an active imagination</li>
			<li>He fancies himself a swashbuckling hero and puts on "shows" with his companions - a headless Barbie, a dead insect, and a wind-up plastic fish.</li>
			<li>But when his owner's car makes a harsh turn, Rango's terrarium falls out onto the highway, leaving him utterly alone in the Mojave Desert. After following the advice of a sage armadillo.</li>
			<li>Rango comes across a female lizard named Beans, who takes him to her Old West hometown of Dirt, where water is such a scarce commodity that it's kept in a bank.</li>
			<li>Rango spins yarn after yarn about being a legendary bandit killer and manages to fell a killer hawk that terrorizes the town, so Dirt's mayor names him sheriff.</li>
			<li>But when Rango unintentionally allows the town's water supply to be stolen, he must either find it or admit that he's just a pretender.</li>
